# SciPy 2015 Tutorial Proposal<a id="sec-1"></a>

What is the topic of your tutorial? Who will this be most useful for?
Please explain briefly at a high level. For ideas, please see last
years examples.

# Tutorial Topic<a id="sec-2"></a>

Economics, Sociology and Psychology are becoming increasingly
computational. Yet, these fields do not always even agree on let alone
employ best practices. Last year when I asserted that social
scientists were under-represented at SciPy, someone asked me if I had
data. So, I asked the crow how many social scientists were there, and
about 3 people raised their hands. How can we get these people in the
door? Exposure to scientific python will helpp these fields develope
rigorous computational practice. We should hold a tutorial for them!

# Student's Python Knowledge Level<a id="sec-3"></a>

-   Beginner

# Please provide a more detailed abstract of your tutorial (again, see last years tutorials).<a id="sec-4"></a>

Unlike the STEM crowd that dominates SciPy, computational skills are
not a standard part of social science curricula. We will provide a
overview of often assumed knowledge: filesystems and databases; text
editors, IDEs, and graphical debugging; command line and notebook
interfaces to Python; the basics of how data is organized on disk, how
it's communicated over networks, and how it's loaded into memory; and
fundamental data structures. We'll keep things interesting by using
data that's interesting to a social scientist: simpl web-scraping,
text analysis of hip-hop lyrics, crime mapping, and economic
time-series visualization. You are also welcome to join, even if
you're coming from a STEM background, if you'd like to get some ideas
about how to train folks from other backgrounds!

Dav Clark has developed and taught a variety of data science topics to
social scientists at the UC Berkeley D-Lab, and more recently at the
Berkeley Institute for Data Science. He has shepherded the campus
python community over the past year, more recently encouraging STEM
folks to join The Hacker Within, while shifting gears to more "social
computing." Evan Misshula is a Data Scientist at the John Jey Research
and Evaluation Center at the City University of New York. He is an
active member of the New York R and Pytho communities, and avidly
publishes tutorials on python and other topics here:
